"""
Find stub nodes that were created from cross-module references but not yet enriched.

Stub Issues: Created when commits reference Jira issue keys (from branch names or commit messages)
             but those issues haven't been loaded from Jira yet.

Stub Teams:  Created when Jira Epics reference team names but those teams haven't been loaded
             from GitHub yet.

This script helps identify which nodes need to be loaded from the other system, or which
references might be invalid.
